        <p>My name is Valerie Hill. I'm learning to be a web coder, but I have been a creator all my 
        life. I love to make art using mixed-media. My work usually consists of paint, colored
        pencil, image transfer, conte crayon, charcoal, and sometimes sequins, and embroidery.
        </p>
        
        <p>The images I use were all taken by me. The photgraphy is sometimes manipulated before
        transferring. I'm inspired by imagery of nature, animals, and themes from my life,
        my family, pets, my personal history, religious imagery, my ethnic identity, and anything
        I find aesthetically pleasing.</p>
